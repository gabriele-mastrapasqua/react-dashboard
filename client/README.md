# Analytics dashboard client

This is a single page application that shows the advertisement views coming from mobile devices and that answers the following questions:

* How many impressions are coming from each device?
* How many impressions for each hour of the day?

and also is nice to have:

* How many impressions for each day of the week?
* How many impressions for each day of the month?
* How many impressions for each country? (no geocoding needed, the provided map should be useful and a map visualization would be great here)
* WebGL visualizations
* Using docker
